THIS WEB APPLICATION IS BASICALLY ABOUT BMI CALCULATOR AND MENTAL HEALTH TRACKER.
The word health refers to a state of complete emotional and physical well-being. 
Healthcare exists to help people maintain this optimal state of health. Nowadays people are so busy they hardly get time to think about health 
To solve this problem we are creating an application named “Health Life”
Health life is a mobile application which displays the medical related information based on user’s choice. For physical health we have BMI calculator and for mental health we have mental health tracker.
Mental health tracker provides optimum solution based on user’s response to general questions.
The body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual.
The BMI is an attempt to quantify the amount of tissue mass in an individual, and then categorize that person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on that value
Mental health refers to a person's overall psychological well-being and ability to function in daily life.
Based on the responses provided by the user, we determine the mental state of a person, whether he is happy or sad.
If the person’s mental health is not good we suggest nearby therapists and possible solutions to improve his mental health.
The existing system is somewhat time-consuming and hard to calculate. Calculators are small, portable electronic devices used to perform simple as well as complex calculations in a fraction of a second. The idea of a calculator came from Abacus used long back in 2000 BC; after that, there were various inventions and mechanical calculators came into use. Scientific calculators were made to solve scientific calculations. 
But in the 21st century when people have started using laptops, tablets, smartphones etc. then why would they carry such calculators? So in this project, we are introducing a Web application known as the BMI calculator, where we can calculate the BMI of a person from their height and weight. The users of this application will have a tool to do all sorts of calculations with ease.
here are many causes of stress, including personal difficulties (e.g. conflict with loved ones, being alone, lack of income, worries about the future), problems at work (e.g. conflict with colleagues, an extremely demanding or insecure job) or major threats in your community (e.g. violence, disease, lack of economic opportunity).
Increased risk for mental health issues is persistent in today’s society where users don’t prefer to go to hospital rather visit various web applications  .

So we bring to you a web application which will give suggestions on basis of the chat bot answers by user along with the BMI calculator.

The chat bot will judge the answers of the user based on which it will rate the mental health of the user within a certain parameter in terms of percentage.
Nowadays people have a very busy lifestyle , and that’s why they want everything as per their convenience , and talking about health , people don’t take care of their health properly due to lack of time and availability of sources at one place. 
So here we are creating a HEALTH LIFE application which will help people in managing their health problems even in busy schedule with the help of BMI CALCULATOR along with MENTAL HEALTH TRACKER.
In this we will provide the viewers with BMI CALCULATOR which will calculate the BMI ratio  of the person by which people will get to know if they have excess body fat as per their height. 
We will provide the diet plan to the users as per their BMI ratio.
MENTAL HEALTH TRACKER  is a health tracker which will keep the track of the user’s mental health .
In this there will be a chatbot that will ask several questions to the user  and on the basis of the answers that the user will give ,the tracker will calculate their mental health state in form of percentage .
On the basis of the percentage it will give solutions to the user to improve their mental health.
The application will also use  an API for captcha verification so that registered users can verify and then login.
The system has been made using HTML, CSS, and JS  and Bootstrap as the front-end technologies with PHP as the backend communicator with MySQL database. The system will be implemented with the basic MySQL connection module of the PHP i.e. mysqli_connect().

The system after entering height and weight will provide the diet recommendation to the specific user with BMI details. The system can also provide suggestions to gain or lose weight.

With the Query answer Technique for mental health, a person's mood is analysed and different activities are recommended.
The BMI Calculator App is a software application which avoids more manual hours that there is no need to be spent personally calculating and finding the BMI for a particular person as here we get it on a single click.
This application keeps both the standard in it i.e. The American standard and the Indian standards.
Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community.
Mental health is determined by a complex interplay of individual, social and structural stresses and vulnerabilities.
Exposure to unfavourable social, economic, geopolitical and environmental circumstances – including poverty, violence, inequality and environmental deprivation – also increases people’s risk of experiencing mental health conditions.
Our intuitive UI design helps people to understand their mental health by determining the person’s mood using the Query Answer Technique (QAT) and analyzing their mood and gives a score of your mental health and recommends activities for uplifting poor mental health.
